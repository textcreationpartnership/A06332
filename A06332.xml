            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:9288:3"/>his Maieſties Soueraignty, and that nothing reſted to be ſubdued but Hungaria. The ſaid Emperour ſent the Earle of Bucquoy, his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Generall, with an Army of Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene Thouſand men, to driue Bethlem Gabor out of Hungaria, who hauing taken from him the Towne Edemberg, Presburgh, and the Caſtle, Oſtia, Filech, and other places. At the laſt he planted his Campe before Newheuſel, vpon the ſeauenth of Iune. This place is one of the Forts of moſt importance in higher Hungaria, well fortified with Souldiers, and of all thinges elſe that belongeth to withſtand a Siege. In the meane time Bethlem (that knewe that the ſiege be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Newheuſel would continue long) went to Buda, there to aduance (as it is thought) the great Turkes ayde, (whoſe deſignes he hath promiſed to execute in Hungaria) and to ſend 3000. Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Ttanſiluanians to releeue New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heuſel, which by the way were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9288:3"/>by the Baron de Setchi, &amp; their Enſignes ſent to Vianna, The Riuer of Taroſe was a great hinderance vnto the Earle of Bucquoy to prepare his battery before the Towne, for that thereon hee was forced to erect his mounts to place his Cannon vpon them. But Bethlem that ſlept not in his deſignes knew well that the loſſe of that place, (wherein a part of Bethlems riches and the treaſures of the Lords of Hungary are) would driue him out of the Countrey; hauing receiued a great ayde of Turkes &amp; Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians, being part of the Turkes great Army ſent towards Poland, reſolued by all the meanes that hee could vſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force Bucquoy to raiſe his ſiege, and if it were posſible, ſodainly to ſurpriſe him, before he could receaue any ayde from the Emperor or any other of his friends? and to that end cauſed the Tartarians to march forward, (being a kinde of the moſt inhumane people liuing vpon the face of the earth, men whom no paines
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9288:4"/>nor labour can weary, and moſt ready and prompt in their deſignes, and much more in their retraicts) who being 6000. men, and Bethlem himſelfe following with as many Turks, Tranſiluanians, and Hungarians, they ſodainly ſet vpon the Emperours army, that beſieged New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heuſel on all ſides. At which time the Earle of Bucquoy that forſooke not the Campe for feare of the Enemy, (but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſignes of an incomparable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour behinde him) perceiuing himſelfe to be ſurprized, aſwell as hee could, ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his men in order of Battaile, being reſolued in that extremity not to flie nor yet to bee ſurprized for want of dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but rather to Fight till he dyed, for the honour of God againſt his enemies, and in the Emperours cauſe againſt his vſurpators. The courage of this braue Souldier was not abaſhed at the ſight of the Turbans and Turkiſh falchions, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet at Bethlems forces, but reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined to ſell his life deare vnto
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9288:4"/>them, and that if they tooke it from him, it ſhould not be ſo good cheape as they made account of, for to flie he ſaw it was a thing vnworthy and not fit for the courage of ſuch a great Commaunder, (whoſe heart was ſeated in a higher place) but reſolued rather not to liue, after hee ſhould ſee the ouerthrow and diſperſing of his Army, and ſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a prey vnto his enemies, as alſo that he could not otherwiſe chuſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the enemy both before and behind him: hauing in compariſon but a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of men, in regard of the puiſſant ayde that came with Bethlem Gabor, he defended himſelfe with ſo great valour, that it was not posſible to ſee a more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious combat, nor a more forcible reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance then then was made on both ſides, wherein that valiant Captaine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt couered with Arrowes, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of his Souldiers was ſlaine, being thrice ſhot, and ſo fell downe to the ground.
